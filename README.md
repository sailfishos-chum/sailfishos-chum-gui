# SailfishOS:Chum GUI application
**SailfishOS:Chum GUI is a graphical client application for managing software packages from the SailfishOS:Chum community repository.**

### Feature set
The SailfishOS:Chum GUI application deploys the same repository configuration as either of the [SailfishOS:Chum repository configuration RPMs](https://github.com/sailfishos-chum/sailfishos-chum-repo-config#readme) do, hence one can alternatively use command line tools as `pkcon` or `zypper` at any time.

### How to install the SailfishOS:Chum GUI application
See [sailfishos-chum/main#how-to-install-the-sailfishoschum-gui-application](https://github.com/sailfishos-chum/main#how-to-install-the-sailfishoschum-gui-application).

### Important notes
* If you experience issues when installing, removing or updating packages after a SailfishOS upgrade, try running `devel-su pkcon refresh` in a terminal app.
* Before software can be build for a SailfishOS release at the SailfishOS-OBS, Jolla must create a [corresponding "download on demand (DoD)" OBS-repository](https://build.sailfishos.org/project/subprojects/sailfishos).  It may take a little time after a new SailfishOS release is published before the corresponding "DoD" repository is being made available, during which installing the SailfishOS:Chum GUI application by the SailfishOS:Chum GUI Installer or updating the SailfishOS:Chum GUI application by itself on a device with the new SailfishOS release already installed does not work, because the SailfishOS:Chum GUI application cannot be compiled for this new SailfishOS release at the Sailfish-OBS, yet; consequently this is always the case for "closed beta (cBeta)" releases of SailfishOS.  In such a situation one has to manually download the SailfishOS:Chum GUI application built for the last prior SailfishOS "general availability (GA)" release (e.g. from [the SailfishOS:Chum repository](https://build.sailfishos.org/package/show/sailfishos:chum/sailfishos-chum-gui)), then install or update the SailfishOS:Chum GUI application via `pkcon install-local <downloaded RPM file>`, and hope that there is no change in the new SailfishOS release which breaks the SailfishOS:Chum GUI application; if there is, please report that soon at [SailfishOS:Chum GUI application's issue tracker](https://github.com/sailfishos-chum/sailfishos-chum-gui/issues).
* Disclaimer: The SailfishOS:Chum GUI application and its installer may still have flaws, kill your kittens or break your SailfishOS installation!  Although this is very unlikely after years of testing by many users, new flaws may be introduced in any release (as for any software).  Mind that the license you implicitly accept by using the SailfishOS:Chum GUI application or the SailfishOS:Chum GUI Installer excludes any liability.
